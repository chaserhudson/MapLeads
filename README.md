## üîß Configuration

MapLeads uses a simple JSON configuration that you can set up interactively:

```json
{
  "monitoring": {
    "categories": ["restaurant", "gym", "dentist"],
    "locations": {
      "states": ["CA", "TX"],
      "cities": ["Los Angeles", "Houston"],
      "min_population": 50000
    },
    "schedule": "daily"
  },
  "notifications": {
    "email": "your@email.com",
    "webhook": "https://your-webhook-url.com",
    "filters": {
      "only_with_reviews": false,
      "only_without_reviews": false,
      "only_with_website": true
    }
  }
}
```

## üéØ Finding New Businesses

MapLeads excels at identifying newly established businesses by:

- **No Reviews Filter**: Use `only_without_reviews: true` to find businesses with no reviews yet - a strong indicator they're new
- **Daily Monitoring**: Catch businesses within days of their Google Maps listing
- **Historical Comparison**: Only alerts you about businesses not seen in previous scans
- **First-Mover Advantage**: Reach out to new businesses before your competitors

## üìä How It Works

1. **Continuous Monitoring**: MapLeads regularly scans Google Maps based on your configuration
2. **Change Detection**: Compares results with previous scans to identify new listings
3. **Smart Filtering**: Applies your criteria to reduce noise
4. **Instant Alerts**: Notifies you through your preferred channel
5. **Data Storage**: Keeps a local history for analysis and export

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Chrome browser
- 2GB RAM minimum (4GB recommended for parallel mode)

### Detailed Setup

1. **Install MapLeads**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chaserhudson/MapLeads.git
   cd MapLeads
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run Interactive Setup**:
   ```bash
   python mapleads.py setup
   ```
   This will guide you through:
   - Selecting business categories to monitor
   - Choosing geographic areas
   - Setting up notifications
   - Configuring scan frequency

3. **Establish Baseline** (First-time users):
   ```bash
   python mapleads.py baseline
   ```
   This populates your database with existing businesses so future scans can detect truly NEW businesses.

4. **Start Monitoring**:
   ```bash
   python mapleads.py run
   ```

## üéÆ Commands

- `python mapleads.py setup` - Interactive configuration wizard
- `python mapleads.py baseline` - Establish baseline (first-time users)
- `python mapleads.py run` - Start monitoring with current config
- `python mapleads.py test` - Run a test scan (10 searches)
- `python mapleads.py status` - View monitoring statistics
- `python mapleads.py export` - Export data to CSV/JSON
- `python mapleads.py categories` - List available business categories

### First-Time Setup

When running MapLeads for the first time, establish a baseline to avoid false positives:

```bash
# 1. Configure your preferences
python mapleads.py setup

# 2. Establish baseline (IMPORTANT for first-time users)
python mapleads.py baseline

# 3. Start monitoring for NEW businesses
python mapleads.py run
```

**Why baseline mode?** Without a baseline, every business will appear "new" since your database is empty. The baseline scan populates your database with existing businesses, so future scans can accurately detect genuinely new businesses that appear after your baseline.

## üìà Advanced Usage

### Custom Categories
```python
# Add custom search terms to config.json
"categories": ["dog groomer", "pet store", "veterinarian"]
```

### Parallel Processing
```bash
# Use 3 parallel browsers for faster scanning
python mapleads.py run --parallel 3
```

### Webhook Integration
```python
# Configure webhook in config.json
"webhook": {
  "url": "https://your-app.com/new-leads",
  "headers": {
    "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_TOKEN"
  }
}
```

### Scheduling
```bash
# Run with cron (Linux/Mac)
0 9 * * * cd /path/to/MapLeads && python mapleads.py run --headless

# Or use the built-in scheduler
python mapleads.py daemon
```

- Business name
