   - Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows)
   - Navigate to the folder: `cd Desktop/MapLeads-main`

2. **One-Click Installation**:

   ./install.sh
   ```

3. **Set Up Your Preferences**:
   ```bash
   ./run.sh setup
   ```

4. **Start Finding Leads**:

   ```

### For Technical Users

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/chaserhudson/MapLeads.git
cd MapLeads

# Create virtual environment (recommended)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run interactive setup
python mapleads.py setup

# Start monitoring

```

## üìñ Use Cases

- **Service Providers**: Find new gyms to sell equipment or services
- **B2B Software**: Identify new service businesses for your software solutions
- **Contractors**: Discover new businesses that might need renovations
- **Marketing Agencies**: Track new businesses that need marketing services
- **Local Services**: Monitor competitors or potential partners in your area

## üìù Category Notes

**Best Performance**: Home services (plumber, electrician, HVAC, contractor, etc.) work exceptionally well as phone numbers are readily visible in search results.

**Limited Support**: Restaurants, cafes, and food businesses may have incomplete phone number extraction since Google Maps often requires clicking individual business cards to access contact details.

## üîß Configuration

MapLeads uses a simple JSON configuration that you can set up interactively:

```json
{
  "monitoring": {
    "category": "plumber",
    "locations": {
      "states": ["CA", "TX"],
      "cities": ["Los Angeles", "Houston"],
      "min_population": 50000
    },
    "batch_size": 10,
    "browser_instances": 1
  }
}
```

## üéØ Finding New Businesses

MapLeads excels at identifying newly established businesses by:

- **Daily Monitoring**: Catch businesses within days of their Google Maps listing
- **Historical Comparison**: Only shows you businesses not seen in previous scans
- **First-Mover Advantage**: Reach out to new businesses before your competitors

## üìä How It Works

1. **Continuous Monitoring**: MapLeads regularly scans Google Maps based on your configuration
2. **Change Detection**: Compares results with previous scans to identify new listings
3. **Data Storage**: Keeps a local history for analysis and export

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

### Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Chrome browser
- 2GB RAM minimum (4GB recommended for parallel mode)

### Detailed Setup

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chaserhudson/MapLeads.git
   cd MapLeads
   
   # Create virtual environment (recommended)
   python3 -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Run Interactive Setup**:

## üéÆ Easy Commands (Non-Technical)

- `./run.sh setup` - Set up MapLeads for the first time
- `./run.sh` - Start finding new businesses
- `./run.sh status` - See what you've found so far
- `./run.sh export` - Save your leads to a CSV file
- `./run.sh test` - Quick test to make sure everything works
- `./run.sh category plumber` - Change what type of business to find
- `./run.sh instances 3` - Use 3 browsers for faster results
- `./run.sh categories` - See all available business types

## üéÆ Technical Commands

- `python mapleads.py setup` - Interactive configuration wizard
- `python mapleads.py run` - Start monitoring with current config
- `python mapleads.py test` - Run a test scan
- `python mapleads.py status` - View monitoring statistics

## üìà Advanced Usage

### Custom Categories
