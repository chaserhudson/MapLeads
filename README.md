## 🚀 Quick Start

### For Non-Technical Users (Easiest)

1. **Download MapLeads**:
   - Click the green "Code" button → "Download ZIP"
   - Extract the ZIP file to your Desktop
   - Open Terminal (Mac) or Command Prompt (Windows)
   - Navigate to the folder: `cd Desktop/MapLeads-main`

2. **One-Click Installation**:
   ```bash
   ./install.sh
   ```

3. **Set Up Your Preferences**:
   ```bash
   ./run.sh setup
   ```

4. **Start Finding Leads**:
   ```bash
   ./run.sh
   ```

### ⚠️ **Important First-Time Setup Notes**

**Your first run establishes a baseline** - this means MapLeads will scan your chosen areas and save all existing businesses to its database. **You won't see "new" businesses on the first run** because everything is new to the empty database.

**On your second and subsequent runs**, MapLeads will compare against this baseline and only show you truly NEW businesses that weren't there before.

**⏱️ Expected Initial Scan Times:**
- **Single State (e.g., California)**: 30-60 minutes
- **Multiple States (e.g., CA, TX, FL)**: 2-4 hours  
- **Nationwide + High Population (50k+)**: 4-8 hours
- **Nationwide + No Population Limit**: 8-24 hours (40,000+ zip codes!)

💡 **Tip**: Start with a single state and higher population limit (100k+) for your first test run.

### For Technical Users

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/chaserhudson/MapLeads.git
cd MapLeads

# Create virtual environment (recommended)
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run interactive setup
python mapleads.py setup

# Start monitoring
python mapleads.py run
```

## 📖 Use Cases

- **Service Providers**: Find new gyms to sell equipment or services
- **B2B Software**: Identify new service businesses for your software solutions
- **Contractors**: Discover new businesses that might need renovations
- **Marketing Agencies**: Track new businesses that need marketing services
- **Local Services**: Monitor competitors or potential partners in your area

## 👀 Viewing Your Data While Monitoring

**While MapLeads is running**, you can view your data in a second terminal window:

1. **Open a new Terminal/Command Prompt window**
2. **Navigate to your MapLeads folder**: `cd Desktop/MapLeads-main`
3. **Check your statistics**: `./run.sh status`
4. **Export your data**: `./run.sh export`
5. **View recent discoveries**: Look for the CSV file in your folder

**Don't stop the monitoring window** - let it keep running to find new businesses!

## 📝 Category Notes

**Best Performance**: Home services (plumber, electrician, HVAC, contractor, etc.) work exceptionally well as phone numbers are readily visible in search results.

**Limited Support**: Restaurants, cafes, and food businesses may have incomplete phone number extraction since Google Maps often requires clicking individual business cards to access contact details.

## 🔧 Configuration

MapLeads uses a simple JSON configuration that you can set up interactively:

```json
{
  "monitoring": {
    "category": "plumber",
    "locations": {
      "states": ["CA", "TX"],
      "cities": ["Los Angeles", "Houston"],
      "min_population": 50000
    },
    "batch_size": 10,
    "browser_instances": 1
  }
}
```

## 🔄 Understanding How MapLeads Works

### First Run (Baseline Establishment)
- **What happens**: MapLeads scans all locations and saves every business it finds
- **What you'll see**: Hundreds or thousands of businesses added to your database
- **Important**: These are NOT "new" businesses - they're just new to your database
- **Time required**: See timing estimates above

### Second Run Onwards (True New Business Detection)
- **What happens**: MapLeads compares current scan against your baseline
- **What you'll see**: Only businesses that weren't there before (truly NEW businesses)
- **Typical results**: 0-50 new businesses per run (depending on your area/category)
- **Time required**: Much faster since it's just checking for changes

### What Makes a Business "New"?
- Business just created their Google Maps listing
- Business just started appearing in search results for your category
- Business recently opened and is now discoverable online

## 🎯 Finding New Businesses

MapLeads excels at identifying newly established businesses by:

- **Daily Monitoring**: Catch businesses within days of their Google Maps listing
- **Historical Comparison**: Only shows you businesses not seen in previous scans
- **First-Mover Advantage**: Reach out to new businesses before your competitors

## 📊 How It Works

1. **Continuous Monitoring**: MapLeads regularly scans Google Maps based on your configuration
2. **Change Detection**: Compares results with previous scans to identify new listings
3. **Data Storage**: Keeps a local history for analysis and export

## 🎮 Easy Commands (Non-Technical)

- `./run.sh setup` - Set up MapLeads for the first time
- `./run.sh` - Start finding new businesses
- `./run.sh status` - See what you've found so far
- `./run.sh export` - Save your leads to a CSV file
- `./run.sh test` - Quick test to make sure everything works
- `./run.sh category plumber` - Change what type of business to find
- `./run.sh instances 3` - Use 3 browsers for faster results
- `./run.sh categories` - See all available business types
- `./run.sh help` - Show all available commands

## 📋 Best Practices for New Users

### Start Small
1. **Choose 1-2 states** instead of nationwide for your first run
2. **Set minimum population to 100,000+** to reduce scan time
3. **Use 2-3 browser instances** for faster results (if you have 4GB+ RAM)

### Monitor Progress
- Watch the terminal for progress updates
- Each location shows how many businesses were found
- New businesses are marked with ✨ when discovered

### Check Your Results
- Run `./run.sh status` to see total businesses found
- Run `./run.sh export` to save your leads to CSV
- Open the CSV file in Excel or Google Sheets to view/sort your leads

### Optimize Performance
- **Faster**: Increase browser instances (`./run.sh instances 3`)
- **Slower but safer**: Use 1 browser instance if you have memory issues
- **Target better**: Increase minimum population or focus on specific states

## 🎮 Technical Commands

- `python mapleads.py setup` - Interactive configuration wizard
- `python mapleads.py run` - Start monitoring with current config
- `python mapleads.py test` - Run a test scan
- `python mapleads.py status` - View monitoring statistics
- `python mapleads.py export` - Export data to CSV/JSON
- `python mapleads.py categories` - List available business categories


## 📈 Advanced Usage

### Custom Categories
```python
# Set custom search term in config.json
"category": "dog groomer"
```

### Parallel Processing
```bash
# Use 3 parallel browsers for faster scanning
python mapleads.py instances 3
python mapleads.py run
```

**Performance Impact**: 2-3 instances provide 2-3x faster scanning. Higher instances (4-5) offer greater speed but require more system resources (4GB+ RAM recommended).


### Scheduling
```bash
# Run with cron (Linux/Mac)
0 9 * * * cd /path/to/MapLeads && python mapleads.py run --headless

```
